# Assets Threats and Vulnerabilities



**Risk**:

```

	Any thing that impacts the confidenciality, integrity, and availability of an asset is called as a risk.
	
```



**Asset**:

```

	Asset is any thing that has value to an organization.
	
```



**Vulnerability**:

```

	Vulnerability is a weakness that can be exploited.
	
```



**Asset Management**:

```

	

Asset Management is the process of tracking assets and risks that affect them.
	
```



**Asset Inventory**:

```

	Asset Inventory is a catelog of assets that need to be protected.
	
```



**Asset Classification**:

```

	Asset Classification is the practice of labelling asset based on sensitivity and importance to an organization.
	
Levels of asset classification:

1. Public
2. Internal only
3. Confidential
4. Restricted
```



**States of Data**:

```

Data can be in any of the three states. No matter the state is we need to protect it.

1.Data in Use:
	Data being used by one or more users.
	
2. Data in Transit:
	Data is being transmitting from one point to another.
	
3.Data at Rest:
	Data not currently being transmitted.
	
```

 

**Information Security**:

```

	Information Security is the practice of keeping data in all states away from unauthorized users.
	
	==Burning Glass==
	
```



**Information Privacy**:

```

	Information Privacy is protection of unauthorized access and distribution of data.
	
```



**Elements of Security Plan**:

```

1.Policy:
	Set of rules that reduces risk and protects information.
	
2. Standards:
	References that inform how to set policies.
	
3. Procederes:
	Step by step instructions to perform a specific securit tasks.
	
```



**Compliance**:

```

	The process of adhering to internal standards and external regulations.
	
```



**Regulations**:

```

	Regulations are rules set by the government or other authorities to control the way something is done.
	
```



**NIST Cybersecurity Framework components**:

- NIST Cybersecurity Framework mainly consists of 3 components.

1. Core
   - Core determines the duties of security plan.
   - They include
     1. Identify
     2. Protect
     3. Detect
     4. Respond
     5. Recover
2. Tiers
   - Determine ways to measure performance.
   - There are 3 tiers
     1. Passive
     2. Null(Will be filled later)
     3. Null(Will be filled later)
     4. Adaptive
3. Profiles
   - Profiles provide insights of securit



**Security Controls**:

​	Safeguards designed to reduce specific security risks.

There are three type of security controls:

1. Technical
   - Encryption
   - Authentication Systems
2. Operational
   - maintain day to day security environment
3. Managerial
   - Policies, standards and procedures.



**Data Life cycle**:

```

	collect --> store --> use --> archive --> destroy
	
```



**Data Governance**:

​	Data Governance is a set of processes that define how an organization manages information.

1. Data Owner
   - A person that decides who can access, edit, use or destroy their information.
2. Data Custodian
   - Anyone or anything that is responsible for the safe handling, transportation and storage of information.
3. Data Steward
   - The person or group that maintains and implements data governance policies set by organization.


### Public key Infrastructure

   An encryption framework that secures the exchange of information online.
   1. Exchange of encrypted information.
   2. Establish a trust using a system of digital certificates.

#### Digital Certificate

   A file that verifies a identity of a public key holder.

#### Non-repudiation

   The concept that the authenticity of the information cannot be denied.

### Phishing

   Phishing is the use of digital communications to trick people into revealing sensitive data or deploying malicious software.

   Email phishing is a type of attack sent via email in which threat actors send messages pretending to be a trusted person or entity.

   Smishing is a type of phishing that uses Short Message Service (SMS).

   Vishing refers to the use of voice calls or voice messages to trick targets into providing personal information over the phone.

   Spear phishing is a subset of email phishing in which specific people are purposefully targeted, such as the accountants of a small business.

   Whaling refers to a category of spear phishing attempts that are aimed at high-ranking executives in an organization.

   Phishing safety measures.
      1. Anti pishing policies
      2. Employee training resources.
      3. Email filters
      4. Intrusion prevention systems

### Malicious software

   Malware is software designed to harm devices or networks.

   A virus is malicious code written to interfere with computer operations and cause damage to data and software.

   A worm is malware that can duplicate and spread itself across systems on its own.

   A trojan, also called a Trojan horse, is malware that looks like a legitimate file or program.

   Advertising-supported software, or adware, is a type of legitimate software that is sometimes used to display digital advertisements in applications.

   Spyware is malware that's used to gather and sell information without consent.

   Fileless malware does not need to be installed by the user because it uses legitimate programs that are already installed to infect a computer.

   A rootkit is malware that provides remote, administrative access to a computer.

   A botnet, short for "robot network," is a collection of computers infected by malware that are under the control of a single threat actor, known as the "bot-herder".

   Ransomware describes a malicious attack where threat actors encrypt an organization's data and demand payment to restore access. 

   Cryptojacking is a type of malware that installs software to illegally mine cryptocurrencies.
   Signs of cryptojacking are:
      Slowdown.
      Increased CPU usage.
      Sudden system crashes.
      Fast draining batteries.


### Cross site scripting(XSS)

   ### Web based exploits

      Malicious code or behaviour that is used to take advantage of coding flaws in a web application.

      Injection attack is a malicious code inserted into a vulnerable application.

   Types of XSS attacks:
      1. Reflected
         Malicious script is sent to server and activated during server's response.

      2. Stored
         An instance when malicious script is injected directly on the server.

      3. DOM-based
         An instance when malicious script exists in the webpage a browser loads.

   SQL Injection
      An attack that executes unexpected queries on a database.
      Categories of SQL injection:
         1. In-band
            An in-band injection is one that uses the same communication channel to launch the attack and gather the results.
         2. Out-of-band
            An out-of-band injection is one that uses a different communication channel  to launch the attack and gather the results
         3. Inferential
            Inferential SQL injection occurs when an attacker is unable to directly see the results of their attack. Instead, they can interpret the results by analyzing the behavior of the system.

   Injection Prevention
   
      Prepared statements: a coding technique that executes SQL statements before passing them on to a database

      Input sanitization: programming that removes user input which could be interpreted as code.

      Input validation: programming that ensures user input meets a system's expectations.

   ### Threat Modelling

      The process of identifying assets, their vulnerabilities, and how each is exposed of threats.
      Threat Modelling steps:
         1. Define the scope
         2. Identify threats
            Threat actors
            Attack Tree : A diagram that maps threats to assets.
         3. Characterize the environment
         4. Analyze threats
         5. Mitigate risks
         6. Evaluate findings

   ### Threat modelling framework
   #### PASTA - Process for attack simulation and threat analysis
   Seven stages of PASTA framework are:
   1. Define business and security objectives
   2. Define the technical scope
   3. Decompose the application
   4. Perform a threat analysis
   5. Perform a vulnerability analysis
   6. Conduct attack modelling
   7. Analyze risk and impact

      Note: Similar threat modelling frameworks are 
         1. STRIDE
         2. Trike
         3. VAST
