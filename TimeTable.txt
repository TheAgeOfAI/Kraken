    Day 3-4: Understanding relationships: scatter plots with sns.scatterplot(), pair plots with sns.pairplot(), and joint plots with sns.jointplot().
    Day 5-7: Advanced visualization techniques: heatmaps (sns.heatmap()), cluster maps (sns.clustermap()), and time series plots (sns.lineplot() with datetime data).

Week 3: Statistical Visualization and Advanced Topics

    Day 1-2: Statistical estimation and error bars: bar plots (sns.barplot()), point plots (sns.pointplot()), and error bars (ci parameter).
    Day 3-4: Regression analysis: understanding and visualizing linear relationships using sns.regplot() and sns.lmplot().
    Day 5-6: Multivariate visualization: using hue, size, and style parameters to visualize multiple variables simultaneously.
    Day 7: Advanced customization and styling: understanding Seaborn's underlying Matplotlib objects for fine-tuning plots, and exploring Seaborn's advanced customization options.

Week 4: Real-world Projects and Application

    Day 1-2: Data visualization projects: work on small projects or datasets to apply what you've learned.
    Day 3-4: Practicing with larger datasets: learn techniques for handling and visualizing larger datasets efficiently.
    Day 5-6: Case studies and examples: explore real-world examples and case studies of Seaborn usage in data analysis and visualization.
    Day 7: Review and reinforcement: revisit any topics or concepts you found challenging, and solidify your understanding through practice and review.




Pandas

Week 1: Introduction to Pandas and Basic Operations

    Day 5-7: Data cleaning and preprocessing: handling missing values, removing duplicates, and performing basic data cleaning operations.

Week 2: Data Manipulation and Analysis

    Day 1-2: Data aggregation and grouping: using groupby to aggregate data and compute summary statistics.
    Day 3-4: Merging and joining datasets: combining multiple DataFrames using merge, join, and concat operations.
    Day 5-7: Advanced data manipulation techniques: reshaping data with pivot, melt, and stack/unstack operations.

Week 3: Time Series Data and Advanced Topics

    Day 1-2: Working with time series data: understanding datetime objects, resampling, and time zone handling.
    Day 3-4: Handling large datasets: techniques for efficient memory management and processing of large datasets.
    Day 5-6: Advanced indexing and selection: using multi-level indexing, hierarchical indexing, and advanced selection techniques.
    Day 7: Performance optimization and best practices: optimizing Pandas code for performance and following best practices for efficient data analysis.

Week 4: Real-world Projects and Application

    Day 1-2: Data analysis projects: work on small projects or datasets to apply what you've learned.
    Day 3-4: Practicing with real-world datasets: explore public datasets and Kaggle competitions to apply Pandas skills in real-world scenarios.
    Day 5-6: Case studies and examples: study real-world examples and case studies of Pandas usage in data analysis and manipulation.
    Day 7: Review and reinforcement: revisit any topics or concepts you found challenging, and solidify your understanding through practice and review.
